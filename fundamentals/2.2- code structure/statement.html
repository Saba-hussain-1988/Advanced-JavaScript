            CODE STRUCTURE
        </h1>
        <p>
            The first thing, We'll study is the building blocks of code.
        </p>

        <h2 style="background-color: skyblue;">STATEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.<br/>
            Statements can be separated with a semicolon.<br/>
            Usually, statements are written in separate lines to make the code more readable.<br/>
        </p>

            SEMICOLONS <image src="C:\Users\Hp\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2024-08-03 144931.gif" width="10" height="30"></image>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exist.<br/>
            Java Script interprets the line break as an <em>"implicit"</em> semicolon.<br/>
            This is called <strong><em>"Automatic Semicolon Insertion"</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <h4 style="background-color: rgb(216, 249, 114);">
            In most cases, A new line implies a semicolon. But <em>"in most cases"</em> does not means always.
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are cases when a new line does not means a semicolon.<br/>
            alert(2 +<br/>3<br/>+ 5)<br/>
            It is intuitively obvious that it is an incomplete expression, So a semicolon there would be incorrect.<br/>
            That works as intended.
        </p>
        <h4  style="background-color: rgb(216, 249, 114);">
            But there are situations where Java Script <em>"fails"</em> to assume a semicolon where is really needed.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.<br/>
            alert("Hello")<br/>[1, 2].foreach(alert);<br/>
            Java Script does not assume semicolon before square brackets[...], So, the code is treated as a single statement.(there's an error)
        </p>
        <p>
            We recommend putting semicolons in between statements even if they are separated by a new lines
        </p>
        <h2 style="background-color: skyblue;">
            COMMENTS
        </h2>
        <P>
            Comments describe what the code does and why.<br/>
            Comments can be put into any place of script, engine simply ignores them.
        </P>
        <h4  style="background-color: rgb(216, 249, 114);">
            One-line comment start with two forward slash characters <image src="C:\Users\Hp\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2024-08-03 154422.gif" width="25" height="30"></image>
        </h4>
        <h4 style="background-color: rgb(216, 249, 114);">
            Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.
        </h4>
        <p>
            The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside /* … */, it won’t execute.

            Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:
        </p>
        <h5>
            Nested comments are not supported!.
        </h5>
